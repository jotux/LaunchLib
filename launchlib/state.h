@brief State machine initialization
@details
Initializes the state machine by saving a pointer to the transition rules,
saving the size (so we can loop through it looking for state changes) and
initially publishes and ENTER event so the first state can initialize whatever
it needs.
@param[in] rules Pointer to state transitions rules table
@param[in] t_size The size of the transition rules table (not accounting for Transition struct size)
@param[in] state The initial state of the state machine
@return A pointer to the state machine struct

@brief Queue a new event
@details
